Unable to Link Closet Due to Captcha Issue / 429 Error / 502 Error / Request Denied
If you’re trying to link your closet in the automation side of the app and you’re getting a captcha issue, it is because of Poshmark’s new update.
You need to try linking your closet again.
Before Linking
First, please make sure you’ve updated your password on Poshmark and confirm it by logging into the Poshmark app or website.
How to Link Your Closet
1. Open the app and select Automation.
2. Tap on the three lines in the upper right corner.
3. Choose Manage Closets and click the plus sign to add a new closet.
4. Enter the name of your closet without the '@' symbol and make sure it is all lowercase.
5. Poshmark will send you a verification code by email or phone.
6. Enter the code and click Verify.

Once done, the app will take 1–2 minutes to link your closet.
If you still get the error, please try again on our web version: app.crosslisting.com

Closet Is Linked but the App Is Prompting to Relink Again and Again
Please note that if the app keeps prompting you to relink, here’s what’s happening:
   * Poshmark Listing Disruption update has not rolled out yet.
   * They are still restoring user listings.
   * Their new security measures are causing closet connections with third-party apps to expire.
   * You may need to relink again until their update is fully rolled out.
   * If it repeats too frequently, we recommend waiting a bit.
   * Once your closet stays linked, sharing will resume normally.

As always, first make sure you’ve updated your Poshmark password and confirmed it by logging into the Poshmark app or website.
